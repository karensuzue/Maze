# Maze Generator
Junior I.S project at the College of Wooster. Most algorithms are heavily referenced from Jamis Buck's Mazes for Programmers. 

## To do list
* Remove Prim's Algorithm from GUI

## Preliminary Software Details
* Run `ASCII_display.py` for ASCII printed maze/version of the software.
* `image_export/exporter.py` for rendering mazes as images

## Built with
* Python
* Python Imaging Library
* Tkinter

## Build Instructions
* Run `GUI/GUI.py`

## Implemented Algorithms
* Binary Tree Algorithm
* Sidewinder Algorithm
* Recursive Backtracker Algorithm
* Prim's Algorithm
* Kruskal's Algorithm
* Wilson's Algorithm
